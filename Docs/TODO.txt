TODO:

- Queued flag set, if DK64.lua fails to find the flag block the first time add the flag set to a queue that is evaluated every frame after that
- Rework input/keybinds, multiple profiles like wasd/arrow keys
- 2D game support
- Rayman 2 rotation stuff
- Toy story 2 stuff
- Never slip enhancements, can't roll/kick on slopes
- Integrate Grab Objects.lua into the DK64 module
- UI framework cleanup, reduce number of parameters passed to Game.initUI(), probably just pass in a key->value table
- BT map support for versions other than US
